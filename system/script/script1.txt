Welcome to Magibomb.
This was opposed to be a storyline.
However, since group 6 is out of 
time, this is now a tutorial....
Regardless, the script handling
system is built. One can control
the background image, standing sprite
and music directly in a .txt file.
There just no time to add content...

Back to the tutorial.
There are 6 different stats to 
each character. hp,mp,soul,speed,
damage, and range. When hp reaches
0 the it's game over, be careful.
mp is used for all kinds of actions
including placing bombs, kicking 
bombs and activating special abilities.
Soul is converted to hp periodically 
when hp is not full. 30 soul currently
heals 4.5% hp. Soul can also be used
to instanly refill mp; the cost goes
up depending on the max mp.Speed is 
how fast the chacter can walk.
Damage affects bomb damage as well
as some abilities' damage. Range is
how many grid the bomb's fire can 
cover.
When a character level up, you again
points that can be used to upgrade
the stats.
The game will auto save every time
a stage is beat.To wipe saves,delete
the game.ser file under /system/save.

Refer to the manual for what keys to
press for what.

Good luck.
